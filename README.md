# Nunjucks snippets for Sublime Text
Snippets are an incredibly powerful way to quickly generate commonly needed code syntax from a shortcut.

The idea is that you can type something like `variable` and then press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key and it will expand into `{{ variable }}`.

You can see all available snippets in [the snippets readme](https://github.com/whatterz/sublime-language-nunjucks/blob/master/snippets/README.md).

## Requirements
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

## Installation
To add your own snippets, select the _Sublime > Tools > Developer > New Snippet..._ menu option if you're using macOS.

To install these snippets on macOS, open the folder _~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/_, create a new folder called _language-nunjucks_ and copy the snippets into the folder.
